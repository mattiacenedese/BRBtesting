# BRBtesting

This repository contains a dataset following experimental tests on a Brake-Reuss beam, with a MATLAB script to visualize them. The data consists of decaying vibrations accelerometer measurements following from hammer impacts or resonance decay, the latter also features DIC data from high speed camera measurements. Moreover, forced frequency response are also present. 

Additional information on the structure, the measurements and their analysis be found in the code of the repository and in the articles:
